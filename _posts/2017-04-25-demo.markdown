### Why I decided to start a blog

### Getting setup
After a couple days of <span style="text-decoration:strikethrough;">struggling</span> learning, I have the Jekyll blog working. Here's a breakdown of what I had to do so far.
* Learn about static site generators. For a good recap on them, take a look at [Static Site Generators](http://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/static-site-generators.csp?intcmp=il-web-free-product-lgen_staticsitegenerators) by Brian Rinaldi
* Pick a static site generator to use (In case you couldn't tell, I used Jekyll)
* Learn the basics of Jekyll
* Try out GitHub Pages (decided to not use this in the end, more on this later)
* Learn about Jekyll Themes and how to build them, which lead to...
* Learning about RubyGems and how to publish them
* Figure out how to package all this stuff and host it somewhere
