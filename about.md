### Welcome!
My name is Dan Rotondo and I'm a UI Developer and UX Designer. I decided to start this blog as way to give back to the design/development communities anything I thought might be useful for others. I also found that writing posts about newly learned topics helps me retain the information better, so it's a win-win for everyone :)

I hope you find some useful insights and feel free to suggest what I should post about next! Enjoy!
